# Knapsack
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/knapsack.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/knapsack)

A handy bag of Sass mixins and utilities, and the Sass little brother to Stylus's [Axis](http://www.github.com/jenius/axis/) Library.

Knapsack only provides pure css as defined by the w3c spec any browser prefixing  can and should be applied by [auto-prefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).

> **note**: This library is in early development and new mixins are being added quickly.  Breaking changes will follow [semver in development](http://markup.im/#q4_cRZ1Qs) until 1.0.
