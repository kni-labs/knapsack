# Knapsack
A grab bag of handy sass utilities and mixins. Full docs coming soon!

Knapsack only provides pure css as defined by the w3c spec any browser prefixing can and should be applied by [auto-prefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).

### Installation
- `bower install knapsack`
- import `knapsack/index` into css pipeline

### Linting / Testing
Scss Linting is provided by [scss-lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint). Let's keep that code tidy.
- Install: `gem install scss-lint`
- Run the test: `scss-lint knapsack -c .scss-style.yml`

#### Hat Tip
Several mixins ported and adapted from the incredible [Axis Stylus Library](http://www.github.com/jenius/axis/) and a resets are from [scut](https://github.com/davidtheclark/scut).
